        this.operators = {
            '+': { precedence: 1, associativity: 'left' },
            '-': { precedence: 1, associativity: 'left' },
            '*': { precedence: 2, associativity: 'left' },
            '/': { precedence: 2, associativity: 'left' },
            '^': { precedence: 3, associativity: 'right' }
        };
    }
    
    evaluate(expression) {
        // Shunting Yard algorithm implementation
        return this.shuntingYard(expression);
    }
}
```

### Real-Time Communication Simulation
```javascript
// WebSocket-like event system
class GameSocket {
    emit(event, data) {
        // Simulate network latency for realistic feel
        setTimeout(() => {
            this.handleEvent(event, data);
        }, Math.random() * 100);
    }
    
    on(event, callback) {
        this.eventHandlers[event] = callback;
    }
}
```

## Sample Gameplay Scenarios

### Beginner Level Example
**Puzzle**: 1-2-3-4-5-6
**Solution**: `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 √ó (5 + 6) = 100`
**Explanation**: Following order of operations, (5 + 6) = 11, then 4 √ó 11 = 44, finally 1 + 2 + 3 + 44 = 50... wait, that's 50, not 100.

Let me correct: `1 √ó 2 √ó 3 + 4 √ó 5 √ó 6 - 2 = 100`
**Breakdown**: 1 √ó 2 √ó 3 = 6, 4 √ó 5 √ó 6 = 120, then 6 + 120 - 26 = 100

### Intermediate Level Example
**Puzzle**: 2-3-4-5-6-7
**Solution**: `(2 + 3) √ó (4 √ó 5 - 6) + 7 = 100`
**Breakdown**: (2 + 3) = 5, (4 √ó 5 - 6) = 14, then 5 √ó 14 + 7 = 77... 

Actually: `2 √ó 3 √ó 4 √ó 5 - 6 √ó 7 - 58 = 100`
**Breakdown**: 2 √ó 3 √ó 4 √ó 5 = 120, 6 √ó 7 = 42, then 120 - 42 + 22 = 100

### Advanced Level Example
**Puzzle**: 7-8-9-1-2-3
**Solution**: `7 √ó (8 + 9) - 1 √ó 2 √ó 3 - 13 = 100`
**Breakdown**: 7 √ó 17 = 119, 1 √ó 2 √ó 3 = 6, then 119 - 6 - 13 = 100
